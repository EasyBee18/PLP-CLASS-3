# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. This project is perfect for beginners to understand input handling, arithmetic operations, and output formatting in Python—with a sprinkle of fun! 😊

## Features ✨

- **Addition** ➕: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction** ➖: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** ✖️: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division** ➗: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero! 🚨).

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Run the script** in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. **Enter the first number** when prompted.
3. **Enter the second number** when prompted.
4. **View the results** for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Example Input/Output:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Notes 📝

- The calculator uses `float` inputs, so **decimals are supported** (e.g., `3.14`).
- **Division by zero** will crash the program—this is intentional for simplicity (but feel free to improve it with error handling! 😉).

## Future Improvements 🔧

- Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
- Include safeguards against division by zero.
- Extend functionality (e.g., exponents, modulus, etc.).
- Add a loop to perform multiple calculations without restarting.

Made with Python and a dash of fun! 😎💻  
Happy calculating! 🎉
